			<h2>Part 1. Mirror and Glass Materials</h2>

			<p><b>
				Show a sequence of six images of scene `CBspheres.dae` rendered with `max_ray_depth` set to 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 100. The other settings should be at least 64 samples per pixel and 4 samples per light. Make sure to include all screenshots.
			</b></p>
			<p>

			</p>
			<br>
			<p><b>
				Point out the new multibounce effects that appear in each image. 
			</b></p>
			<p>
			Your response goes here.
			</p>
			<br>
			<p><b>
				Explain how these bounce numbers relate to the particular effects that appear. Make sure to include all screenshots.
			</b></p>
			<p>
			Your response goes here.
			</p>
			<br>

			<h2>Part 2. Microfacet Material</h2>

			<p><b>
				Show a screenshot sequence of 4 images of scene `CBdragon_microfacet_au.dae` rendered with $\alpha$ set to 0.005, 0.05, 0.25 and 0.5. The other settings should be at least 128 samples per pixel and 1 samples per light. The number of bounces should be at least 5. Describe the differences between different images. Note that, to change the $\alpha$, just open the .dae file and search for `microfacet`.
			</b></p>
			<p>
			Your response goes here.
			</p>
			<br>
			<p><b>
				Show two images of scene `CBbunny_microfacet_cu.dae` rendered using cosine hemisphere sampling (default) and your importance sampling. The sampling rate should be fixed at 64 samples per pixel and 1 samples per light. The number of bounces should be at least 5. Briefly discuss their difference.
			</b></p>
			<p>
			Your response goes here.
			</p>
			<br>
			<p><b>
				Show at least one image with some other conductor material, replacing `eta` and `k`. Note that you should look up values for real data rather than modifying them arbitrarily. Tell us what kind of material your parameters correspond to. 
			</b></p>
			<p>

			</p>
			<br>

			<h2>Part 3. Environment Lightl</h2>

			<b>Pick one *.exr* file to use for all subparts here. Include a converted *.jpg* of it in your website so we know what map you are using.</b>

			<p><b>
				In a few sentences, explain the ideas behind environment lighting (i.e. why we do it/how it works).
			</b></p>
			<p>
			Your response goes here.
			</p>
			<br>
			<p><b>
				Show the *probability_debug.png* file for the *.exr* file you are using, generated using the `save_probability_debug()` helper function after initializing your probability distributions.
			</b></p>
			<p>
			Your response goes here.
			</p>
			<br>
			<p><b>
				Use the `bunny_unlit.dae` scene and your environment map *.exr* file and render two pictures, one with uniform sampling and one with importance sampling. Use 4 samples per pixel and 64 samples per light in each. Compare noise levels. Make sure to include all screenshots.
			</b></p>
			<p>
			Your response goes here.
			</p>
			<br>
			<p><b>
				Use a different image (if you did part 2, we recommend `bunny_microfacet_cu_unlit.dae`) and your environment map *.exr* file and render two pictures, one with uniform sampling and one with importance sampling. Use 4 samples per pixel and 64 samples per light in each. Compare noise levels. Make sure to include all screenshots.
			</b></p>
			<p>
			Your response goes here.
			</p>
			<br>

			<h2>Part 4. Depth of Field</h2>

			<b>
				For these subparts, we recommend using a microfacet BSDF scene to show off the cool out of focus effects you can get with depth of field!
			</b>
			<p><b>
				In a few sentences, explain the differences between a pinhole camera model and a thin-lens camera model. 
			</b></p>
			<p>
			Your response goes here.
			</p>
			<br>
			<p><b>
				Show a "focus stack" where you focus at 4 visibly different depths through a scene. Make sure to include all screenshots.
			</b></p>
			<p>
			Your response goes here.
			</p>
			<br>
			<p><b>
				Show a sequence of 4 pictures with visibly different aperture sizes, all focused at the same point in a scene. Make sure to include all screenshots.
			</b></p>
			<p>
			Your response goes here.
